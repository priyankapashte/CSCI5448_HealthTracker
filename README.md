HealthTracker:

A health monitoring web application aimed at building a system that collects data from sensors and can keep track of
various health parameters such as heart rate, calories burnt, sleep analysis, etc. A database of the Patients and Doctors
profile would be maintained. The Patients can view their health parameters on the web page and report the same to a
Doctor if they want an advice. Also, they can add an advising Doctor and schedule an appointment. The Doctor would be
able to select a Patient, view their report and provide feedback.

Steps to setup:
1. Download the code by cloning the repository
2. JDK is a pre requisite for this web application and versiob supported is 1.8 and above.
3. Include the required jar files for spring and hibernate, and Mysql database connector
4. Setup the apache server to run the web application
5. Change the username and password to match with the MYSQL database in the hibernate configuration file.
6. Once the application is run on the apache server, visit localhost:8080/myapp/ on the browser.
